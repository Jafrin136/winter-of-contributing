JavaScript is a dynamic type of language,It means you don't need to specify type of the variable like int char or float because it is dynamically used in Javascript. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. For eg:

var a=10;//It is holding number  
var b="David";//It is holding string  

ðŸŽ‡Primitive data typesðŸŽ‡

There are five types of Primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:

Data Type	Description
String:Consists of sequence of characters e.g. "I am a robot"
Number:Consists of numeric values e.g.900
Boolean:represents boolean value is either false or true
Undefined	represents:Has undefined value
Null:represents null i.e. no value 

ðŸŽ‡JavaScript non-primitive data typesðŸŽ‡

Object:represents instance through which we can gain access to its members
Array:Consists of similar values
RegExp:Have regular expression


JavaScript has dynamic data types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.The following examples illustrates it:

Example
let x;           // Now x is undefined
x = 100;           // Now x is a Number
x = "Priyanka";      // Now x is a String

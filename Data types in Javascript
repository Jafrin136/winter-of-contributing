JavaScript is a dynamic language,It means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. For eg:

var a=10;//holding number  
var b="David";//holding string  

ðŸŽ‡JavaScript primitive data typesðŸŽ‡

There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:

Data Type	Description
String:represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello World"
Number:represents numeric values e.g. 200
Boolean:represents boolean value either false or true
Undefined	represents:undefined value
Null:represents null i.e. no value 

ðŸŽ‡JavaScript non-primitive data typesðŸŽ‡

Object:represents instance through which we can access members
Array:represents group of similar values
RegExp:represents regular expression


JavaScript Types are Dynamic
JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:

Example
let x;           // Now x is undefined
x = 10;           // Now x is a Number
x = "David";      // Now x is a String
